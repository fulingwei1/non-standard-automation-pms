/**
 * Deprecated: Approval Center Components
 * 审批中心系统组件导出
 *
 * NOTE: These Ant Design-based components are deprecated.
 * The active approval center implementation uses shadcn/ui and is located at:
 * - Page: pages/ApprovalCenter.jsx
 * - Hook: pages/ApprovalCenter/hooks/useApprovalCenter.js
 * - Timeline: components/approval/ApprovalTimeline.jsx
 *
 * These components are kept for backward compatibility only.
 * Please use the page-level implementation for new development.
